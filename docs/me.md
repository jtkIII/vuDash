The first website I coded for pay was 1994.

I was building db connected web apps from the cgi-bin before y2k.

went through php + mySQL for medium sized companies for a decade, did Vue during the 2-3 composition API, did backend ( node + Python)...

Anyway, just saying I know how to do it wrong anyway.

This is my attempt at doing it well, if not *right*.
